/*! @brief Return a mapping of the receiver's property name to its corresponding serialization key.
    @details Implement this to map a property's name to a different string on serialization. The same 
    mapping is used when deserializing the receiver. */
- (NSDictionary<NSString*,NSString*> *)keyMap;

/*! @brief Return a set of property names that should not be included in serialization or deserialization. 
    @details This set can include instance variables as well. */
- (NSSet<NSString*> *)doNotSerialize;

/*! @brief Return a date formatter to convert NSDate objects into a string representation.
    @details The default behavior for NSDate values is to serialize them as strings conforming to the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard.
    e.g. \c yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZZZZ, with the timezone set to GMT. Implement this method to serialize dates in a different format.
    @note This method is only called if the date is serialized/deserialized as a string. i.e. -valueTransformerForProperty: 
    has not transformed the date into Unix time. */
- (NSDateFormatter *)dateFormatterForDateProperty:(NSString *)property;

/*! @brief Return a value transformer for the given property, allowing the property to be serialized as a different type or representation.
    @details Example uses of this method include transforming a date into Unix time instead of a string representation, or 
    transforming an unsupported type into a serializable format. For transforming dates into Unix time, \c UCDateToUnixTimeTransformer 
    is provided as a convenience. It is important to note that this method is \e not called for values in collections, so if collection 
    objects should be transformed in some way (e.g. serialize an array of NSDates to Unix time or some other format),
    return a value transformer for the array property that transforms the array's contents into the desired format.
    @note The returned value transformer must be reversible. */
- (NSValueTransformer *)valueTransformerForProperty:(NSString *)property;

/*! @brief Return the class of the elements contained in the array with the given property name for deserialization.
    @details Implement this method when the array identified by the given property name contains custom objects so that the objects will 
    be properly deserialized. If this method is not implemented, custom objects will be deserialized as  NSDictionaries.
    @note Array properties should be homogeneous. i.e. They cannot contain a mixture of different types. If an array property 
    does contain non-homogeneous types, a value transformer can be used to transform the property into a custom format 
    (e.g. potentially an encoded string). */
- (Class)classForArrayElementsOfProperty:(NSString *)property;

/*! @brief Return the class of the object with the given key path, with the root object being an NSDictionary.
    @details Implement this method when a dictionary contains a custom object as a value in a key-value pair. The key path
    always contains the root dictionary's property as its first element, and follows the Cocoa convention of a dot-separated 
    string of keys. */
